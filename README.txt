Hello and welcome to my "you're learning Python" repository! I've decided to start this as a good way to meet the 100 days of code challenge.

I'll be putting coding challenges I complete on my way through learning Python here. I plan to break it up according to the various resources I'm using / any independent projects I might end up working on.
Feel free to look through anything, tell me how I could have done something better, or just say hello!
